        <p>Safety Data Sheet (SDS) is an important tool in identifying the potential harms that certain substances may
            cause. In most cases, SDS is required to be provided by the manufacturer, importer, or distributor of the
            substance.
            It is important to understand the symbols and the emergency response to take when exposed to these
            substances.
            Below are the symbols and the appropriate emergency response to take when exposed to these substances.
