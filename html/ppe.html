        <p>As previously mentioned, PPE is important for different fields of work. This also includes medical fields and even in the field of construction. In the medical field, PPE may include gloves, gowns, masks, and face shields. This protects the healthcare workers from potential exposure to infectious diseases. 
            PPE in the medical field is also important to protect patients from infections and cross-contamination. In the case of construction, PPE may include hard hats, gloves, and steel-toed boots, which protect workers from potential hazards such as falling objects and electrical hazards. 
            Construction workers may also use hearing protection and fall protection to protect themselves from noise and falls.
